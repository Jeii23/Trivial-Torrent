# Trivial Torrent Project: Client and Server

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project involves the development of a torrent program in C, where both the client and server components are programmed. The program is a trivial torrent, allowing users to share and download files in a peer-to-peer manner. By implementing both the client and server components, this program provides a complete solution for file sharing, allowing users to easily connect and share files with others.
